My research interest is in developing mathematical models and optimization algorithms to solve power system engineering and energy economics problems. Research topics include:

- Power systems operation and planning
- Decarbonization of power grids and renewable energy integration
- Energy storage as grid flexibility resources
- Demand-side resources - electric vehicles, smart buildings, and microgrids
- Electricity market modeling and energy policy design 
- Stochastic and distributed optimization with energy applications
- Grid resilience against extreme weather and cyber-attack
